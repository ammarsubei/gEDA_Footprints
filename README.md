gEDA_Footprints
===============

The collection of custom gEDA footprints for PCB Desginer.
This should be located at '/usr/share/pcb/newlib/' to allow ease of use.
To initially set this up, move the newlib folder, then clone the repository with 'git clone https://github.com/chicagoedt/gEDA_Footprints.git newlib' while in the /usr/share/pcb/ directory. Then paste all the contents from the original newlib folder into the /usr/share/pcb/newlib/ folder. And you should be golden.

NOTE: You need to be root for any content to be updated in this folder.
